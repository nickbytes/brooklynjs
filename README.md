# Building Worlds in Javascript

## How I built a text adventure game in Javascript

This talk was given at BrooklynJS on May 17, 2018. You can see the "slides" here: brooklynjs.nickbytes.com

The "slides" (and this repo) serve as an example for how you can build a text adventure game in React. If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue!

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nickbytes/brooklynjs.git
```

2.  Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
yarn install
```

3.  Start development:

```bash
npm start
yarn start
```

## How is it built?

This boilerplate is created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#typescript) for styling and [refunk](https://github.com/jxnblk/refunk/tree/master/examples) for state management.
